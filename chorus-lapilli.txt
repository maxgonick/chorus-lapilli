(Starting from end of tic-tac-toe project)
    1.) Added new attribute to state object called chorusRules that tracks if it is playing with normal tic-tac-toe rules, or with chorus lapilli rules
    2.) Created helper function "hasThreeSymbols(inputArray)" that checks if a given array has 3 Xs and 3 Os and if so return true. I used this function to update our previous chorusRules attribute in handleClick, as we want to check if the board has 3 Xs and Os placed after each click to see if it should be in tictactoe or chorus lapilli rules. I called hasThreeSymbols on the `current` board array (and added an optimization to bypass this if chorusRules is already true, as we can't move back to tictactoe rules once we are in chorus rules) to check if we should update chorusRules to true.
    3.) Created another helper function isValid, which will output is a given move from a starting spot to the ending spot. This is done by declaring an array, where each index of the array matches up to what spots the square with that index numbers can move. So if the move is a valid one (up,down,left,right,diagonal) we also check if that space is already occupied, and if not return true and in all other cases return false.
