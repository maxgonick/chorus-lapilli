(Starting from end of tic-tac-toe project)
    1.) Added new attribute to state object that tracks if the current Board contains 3 Xs and Os placed called allPlaced and initialized it to false (as when the game starts, there are no symbols on the board)
    2.) Created helper function "hasThreeSymbols(inputArray, symbol)" that checks if a given array has exactly 3 occurances of the given symbol, and if so return true. I used this function to update our previous allPlaced attribute in handleClick, as we want to check if the board has 3 Xs and Os placed after each click. I called hasThreeSymbols on the `current` board array and check if it returned true when passing in X and O, and if so update allPlaced to true.
    3.)
